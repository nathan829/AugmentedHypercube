This repo was created for my summer research scholarship where my project was on embedding the augmented hypercube into certain grids. I needed to create this program to confirm some of my propositions and overall get useful computational results. These results include find the wirelength for a particular embedding, whether the ordering is lexicographic, the improved embedding or just a manual input. This program can also calculate the wirelengt for any type of grid on 2^n vertices
